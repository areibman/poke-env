      "- Your Vileplume is at full HP, with no stat boosts or status.\n",
      "- The opponent's active Pokémon is Jirachi (Steel/Psychic), also at full HP.\n",
      "- Vileplume's available moves are: Giga Drain, Strength Sap, Sludge Bomb, and Sleep Powder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s break down the options:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Giga Drain:** Grass-type move. Not effective against Steel-types (Jirachi resists Grass).  \n",
      "**2. Strength Sap:** Reduces target's Attack and heals Vileplume by Jirachi’s Attack stat. Jirachi is often special or utility-oriented; not optimal first turn (and you are at full HP).  \n",
      "**3. Sludge Bomb:** Poison-type move. Jirachi is a Steel-type, so this move will have no effect (immune).  \n",
      "**4. Sleep Powder:** 75% accurate, but if it hits, puts Jirachi to sleep. Sleep is useful to cripple an opponent, force a switch or buy momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Switching:** You have better team members, but none can immediately threaten Jirachi without taking some risk—Fire Arceus for STAB Judgment, but switching directly into possible Iron Head is risky (though you could consider it soon).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**  \n",
      "**Best move:** `sleeppowder`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:** All your damaging moves are resisted or ineffective against Jirachi. However, Sleep Powder, despite its imperfect accuracy, gives you a chance to immediately put Jirachi to sleep, gaining initiative or forcing a switch, which can be crucial for early momentum. If it fails, you can still consider switching to a more appropriate counter on the following turn, but landing Sleep Powder early is a strong play.\n",

      "- **strengthsap:** Heals you (you're at full HP), and lowers Okidogi’s Attack by 1, but Okidogi is asleep and can’t attack next turn anyway. Not an urgent option.\n",
      "- **sludgebomb:** STAB, 90 base power, super-effective on Okidogi (Fighting is weak to Psychic but not Poison, Poison/Fighting resists Poison, so it is neutral). Chance to poison, but Okidogi is already statused.\n",
      "- **sleeppowder:** Okidogi is already asleep; this move will fail.\n",

      "- **Strength Sap:** Raging Bolt is likely a special attacker (high SpA base stat, and we’ve seen Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, both special). Using Strength Sap to drop its Attack and heal yourself would be less useful, as its Attack stat is low.\n",
      "- **Sludge Bomb:** Poison-type, not very effective on Raging Bolt (Electric resists, Dragon resists), so low damage.\n",
      "- **Sleep Powder:** Can be useful to disrupt if you expect a switch or want to neutralize Raging Bolt for a turn, but has only 75% accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Raging Bolt's Likely Plan\n",
      "- It may use Volt Switch/Thunderbolt to hit Vileplume, but Vileplume resists Electric.\n",
      "- If it is forced out by low HP, Giga Drain will hit any switch moderately hard and heal you.\n",

      "#### Potential Moves:\n",
      "- **Gigadrain**: Super-effective on Raging Bolt (DRAGON/ELECTRIC, weak to Grass). Also heals Vileplume.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Likely Opponent Actions:\n",
      "- Raging Bolt, at -2 SpA, may want to switch out due to the drop in power—potentially using Volt Switch to pivot or switching manually.\n",
      "- If they Volt Switch, Raging Bolt likely doesn’t do much damage, and you get chip healing if you use a damaging move.\n",
      "- If they hard switch, you want a move that is safe against everything, especially against a potential Jirachi.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Best Move:\n",

      "- Jirachi is burned, so its offensive threat is reduced.\n",
      "- Your Rotom-Fan is holding Heavy-Duty Boots, neutralizing the opponent's Stealth Rock, making switching less risky, but there is no immediate need to pivot since Rotom handles Jirachi fine.\n",
      "- `Will-o-Wisp` is redundant because Jirachi is already burned.\n",
      "- `Volt Switch` lets you pivot, but unless you specifically want to bring in another teammate for free, staying in is often safer when you have the advantage.\n",
      "- `Thunderbolt` and `Air Slash` are both damaging options. Thunderbolt is slightly stronger due to Rotom's STAB and higher base power than Air Slash against Jirachi, and avoids the small chance of missing.\n",
      "- Jirachi resists Thunderbolt, but your goal should be to wear it down (especially since all other enemy Pokémon are KO'd except Jirachi), and you can fish for full paralysis with Thunderbolt too (though not reliably).\n",

      "- **Jirachi** is currently burned, which weakens its physical attacking power and causes it to take chip damage every turn.\n",

      "- **Will-O-Wisp** is redundant because Jirachi is already burned.\n",
      "- **Volt Switch** allows you to hit Jirachi for some damage (albeit not much, since it resists Electric), but more importantly, it lets you pivot out to one of your teammates, giving you better momentum and a free switch.\n",
      "- Switching to a Pokémon like **Snorlax** gives you a strong defensive presence; Snorlax resists or shrugs off Iron Head due to Thick Fat and can start setting up with Curse. Alternatively, you can go to **Arceus** for a more direct offensive or defensive response.\n",
