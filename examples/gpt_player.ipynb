      "- The opponent's active Pok√©mon is Jirachi (Steel/Psychic), also at full HP.\n",

      "**1. Giga Drain:** Grass-type move. Not effective against Steel-types (Jirachi resists Grass).  \n",
      "**2. Strength Sap:** Reduces target's Attack and heals Vileplume by Jirachi‚Äôs Attack stat. Jirachi is often special or utility-oriented; not optimal first turn (and you are at full HP).  \n",
      "**3. Sludge Bomb:** Poison-type move. Jirachi is a Steel-type, so this move will have no effect (immune).  \n",
      "**4. Sleep Powder:** 75% accurate, but if it hits, puts Jirachi to sleep. Sleep is useful to cripple an opponent, force a switch or buy momentum.\n",

However, Sleep Powder, despite its imperfect accuracy, gives you a chance to immediately put Jirachi to sleep, gaining initiative or forcing a switch, which can be crucial for early momentum.

      "- It may use Volt Switch/Thunderbolt to hit Vileplume, but Vileplume resists Electric.\n",

      "- `Volt Switch` lets you pivot, but unless you specifically want to bring in another teammate for free, staying in is often safer when you have the advantage.\n",
      "- `Thunderbolt` and `Air Slash` are both damaging options. Thunderbolt is slightly stronger due to Rotom's STAB and higher base power than Air Slash against Jirachi, and avoids the small chance of missing.\n",

      "- **Jirachi** is currently burned, which weakens its physical attacking power and causes it to take chip damage every turn.\n",
      "- Jirachi resists both **Thunderbolt** and **Air Slash** (Steel typing), so you are unlikely to deal significant damage with either of those moves.\n",
      "- **Will-O-Wisp** is redundant because Jirachi is already burned.\n",
      "- **Volt Switch** allows you to hit Jirachi for some damage (albeit not much, since it resists Electric), but more importantly, it lets you pivot out to one of your teammates, giving you better momentum and a free switch.\n",
      "- Switching to a Pok√©mon like **Snorlax** gives you a strong defensive presence; Snorlax resists or shrugs off Iron Head due to Thick Fat and can start setting up with Curse. Alternatively, you can go to **Arceus** for a more direct offensive or defensive response.\n",
